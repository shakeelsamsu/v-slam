go in the ceres-solver/examples folder
change line 213 of bal_problem.cc to have "255 0 0"
go to ceres-bin and run make again (should just make the stuff that changed, not all of ceres)

then run like this:
./bin/bundle_adjuster --input <path_to_bal_file> --initial_ply <initial_cloud_out> --final_ply <final_play_out> --num_iterations 250 --num_threads 8
